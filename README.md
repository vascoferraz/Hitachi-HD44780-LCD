# Hitachi-HD44780-LCD

The Hitachi HD44780 LCD module is well known not only in the hobbyist and small business but also in the professional industry which use these displays in machine/man interfaces like printers, telephones, uninterruptible power supplies, diesel generators and other industrial equipment.

This LCD is cheap, easy to use and it comes in a few number of size configurations: 8×1 (one row of eight characters), 16×2, 20×2, 20×4…

For this project I am going to use a simple library called [LiquidCrystal](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal). But don’t worry, this library is included in the standard package of Arduino 1.0.10 (or later).

For this project you need an **Arduino Nano 3.0**, one **Hitachi HD44780 LCD module**, one **10kOhm trimmer** (to regulate the LCD contrast), a **breadboard** and **wires**.

Now you have to replicate the circuit below:<br/>

Upload the [code](Hitachi_HD44780.ino) to the board.

For more information about this library you can read the official Arduino’s [LiquidCrystal](http://arduino.cc/en/Reference/LiquidCrystal) tutorial where you can find more useful functions and examples.
